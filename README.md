## 👩‍💻 About Me

Hello! I'm Yara Khattab, a fourth-year Computer Engineering student at Birzeit University.  
I love building systems that interact closely with hardware, and I’m especially interested in:

- 🧠 **Low-level programming**
- 🔌 **Embedded systems**
- 🖥️ **Computer networks**
- ⚙️ **Operating systems**

I enjoy challenging projects that blend theory with real-world problem solving.  
Always looking to learn, explore, and build!
